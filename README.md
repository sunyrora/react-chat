# react-chat

Simple react chat app with firebase db.
You can see the [Demo here](https://chatroom-45d5f.firebaseapp.com/).
Enter you name on the front page and login, then click 'chat' button to go to the chat room.


## Test the source

To test the source, you just need the **firebaseConfig.js** file in the 'src/firebase/' diirectory.
In this file, you put your firebase configuration.
Something like..

```js
{
  apiKey: ...,
  authDomain: ...,
  databaseURL: ...,
  projectId: ...,
  storageBucket: ..,
  messagingSenderId: ..
};
```

You can find this information on the [firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com).
